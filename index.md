# Welcome to LeadsCalendar project!

This website outlines the documentation needed to create the LeadsCalendar project -- a pay-to-schedule calendar application.

### Motivation

Have you ever recieved a message asking for an interview only for noone to arrive at the designated time and ask to reschedule? Then this project is aimed at you. The idea behind LeadsCalendar is to ask such people to pay some money for the event to be created. This way even if noone arrives, the time did not go to complete waste.

### Functionality Overview

* Users can create events on Google Calendar through the LeadsCalendar interface.
* Upon event creation, users are prompted to make a payment of 1 USD or its equivalent in cryptocurrency.
* Events are confirmed only after successful payment processing.


### Proposed technological stack

Major dependencies:
- Python Flask
- React
- Docker

Minor dependencies:
- [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar?ref=retool-blog.ghost.io)
- [binance-pay-connector-python](https://github.com/binance/binance-pay-connector-python)
- [google client libraries](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python#install_the_google_client_library)
